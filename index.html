      <h1>Visualization</h1>

      <p>
        Include the interactive visualization as part of this page. Static
        example follows.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class = "vis-holder"> <div> </div>

      <b>Hover over a day in the above bar chart (left) to explore price data for that day in the scatter plot (right).</b>
      	 The above visualization explores surge multiplier and price data for Lyft and Uber rides. From the visualizations, basic observation shows 
      	 that there is not a significant difference in the average surge multiplier based on the day of the week. If surge multipliers are used as a proxy for demand, 
      	 This indicates that while there may exist differences between demand at different times during the week, each day does not exhibit significantly higher or lower demand.
      	</br></br>
      	 Basic observation with the daily Price per Mile chart (right) shows that each day seems to exhibit similar price-per-mile distributions. 
      	 Additional statistical tests should be applied to determine the relationship between day, time, and price.

  <div class = "vis-holder"> <select id="selectButton3"></select></div>

      <p>
        <b> Use the drop down to explore how the average surge multiplier (left) and the average price (right) differs with the different weather conditions</b>
         These graphs show the average surge multiplier (left) and the average price (right) of all rides. This can be compared to different weather conditions using the drop down menu. We have zoomed in on the y-axis for both graphs as the changes between weather conditions are not vast from the average. Without having zoomed in these changes would not be visible. If surge multiplier is a proxy for demand, as stated for visualization 1, we can observe that there is not noticeable change in demand for different weather conditions. The average price also does not differ signifigantly over weather conditions. As we already know that surge multiplier does not change over weather conditions, any chance in price would be a reflection of differing distances traveled. Thus, as there is not change, we can hypothesize that there is not change in distance traveled with differing weather conditions. </br></br>

        <b> Brush over the dots in the above scatter plot (left) to highlight the corresponding data on the graphs adjacent to it. </b>
          The above visualization displays each individual Uber and Lyft trip, which are distinguished by color, based on the price and distance of it. This ultimately portrays how price changes with distance. Once the user brushes over a sample of dots, the corresponding date and surge multiplier data in the graph next to it will be highlighted. In addition, the bar graph portraying the count and location will highlight the individual bars that also correspond with the initial plots that were brushed upon. The significance of this bar chart is to show how many rides start or end in different aggregated locations.This interaction essentially shows how surge multipliers have changed for given dates over time.

      <h1>Demo Video</h1>

      <p>
        Embed an MP4 demo video using the HTML5 &lt;video&gt; tag. For example,
        this screen recording Prof. Cody Dunne made of Mike Bostock's flexible
        transitions in D3 slide:

        <p>
          Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a
