      <h1>Abstract</h1>

      <p>Uber and Lyft have become an important piece of the Boston transportation network. Using data from a simulation with nearly 700,000 rides, we visualize major trends in ridesharing. In addition, we analyze the impact that temperature and other weather conditions have on the network. These visualizations are intended to inform riders and companies alike on trends in ridesharing usage and to allow for further exploration of major trends.</p>

      <h1>Visualization</h1>

      <p>
        The following series of visualizations are intended to allow for the exploration of rideshare trends. The dataset is derived from a realistic simulation with nearly 700,000 rides. The following visualizations use a representative sample of that data.
      </p>

      <p>
        Surge multipliers and price are often indicators of demand in the rideshare business. Thus, we have decided to visualize certain factors versus surge multipliers & price to search for trends.
      </p>

      <p>
        The below visualization is <b>interactive</b>. To change the middle and right scatter plots, use the drop-down menus found above the bar chart on the left. 
      </p>

    <div class='content-column'>

      <p>
      	 The above visualization explores surge multiplier and price data for Lyft and Uber rides. From the visualizations, basic observation shows 
      	 that there is not a significant difference in the average surge multiplier based on the day of the week. Observe the y-axis for the bar chart on the left -- we have zoomed in to show that the difference between each day is miniscule. This is likely because the vast majority of rides during any given day have a surge multiplier of '1x'. Thus, the average surge multiplier each day is cloes to 1. If surge multipliers are used as a proxy for demand, this indicates that while there may exist differences between demand at different times during the week, each day does not exhibit significantly higher or lower demand.
      	</br></br>
      	 Basic observation with the daily Price per Mile chart (right) shows that each day seems to exhibit similar price-per-mile distributions. 
      	 Additional statistical tests should be applied to determine the relationship between day, time, and price.

        <b> Brush over the dots in the above scatter plot (left) to highlight the corresponding data on the graphs adjacent to it. </b>
          The above visualization displays each individual Uber and Lyft trip, which are distinguished by color, based on the price and distance of it. This ultimately portrays how price changes with distance. Once the user brushes over a sample of dots, the corresponding date and surge multiplier data in the graph next to it will be highlighted. In addition, the bar graph portraying the count and location will highlight the individual bars that also correspond with the initial plots that were brushed upon. The significance of this bar chart is to show how many rides start or end in different aggregated locations.This interaction essentially shows how surge multipliers have changed for given dates over time.
