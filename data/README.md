# Note about preliminary data upload

We have a csv that is ~358MB. Thus, we are unable to upload the entire file at once. When creating our visualizations, we will upload seperate CSVs for the sub-visualizations. We will filter the original dataset to only include the necessary columns. In addition, we will only include Uber in our analysis to allow for a lower CSV size. In this submission, we have uploaded a sample of our data, showing the possible columns for the first 15 rows. 


# Put any data files in this folder

Ideally your data is a CSV file.

*Do not commit personally identifying or confidential data!*
If you do so, it is a pain to remove it later and it may have already been crawled by other sources. But [here is how you do so](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository).
