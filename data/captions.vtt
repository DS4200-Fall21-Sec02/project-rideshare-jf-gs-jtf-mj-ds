0:00:04.320 --> 0:00:08.000
Our group looked at a simulation of rideshares in the Boston area.

0:00:08.902 --> 0:00:12.552
Purple dots will represent Lyfts and black dots will represent Uber.

0:00:13.247 --> 0:00:22.821
Our first visualization shows how the average surge multiplier, the y-axis,  changes by day which is seen on the x-axis.

0:00:23.715 --> 0:00:30.000
This can then be compared to the price per mile of a specific day, throughout that day.

0:00:30.000 --> 0:00:34.861
The 24 hour time being on the x-axis and the price per mile on the y.

0:00:35.297 --> 0:00:38.315
Days of the week may be changed using these drop downs.

0:00:39.686 --> 0:00:45.328
Next, one can look at average surge multiplier and average prices for different weather conditions.

0:00:45.659 --> 0:00:50.432
The overall average is always shown but the specific weather condition may be changed using this drop down.

0:00:51.085 --> 0:00:53.293
The weather conditions are on the x-axis

0:00:53.342 --> 0:00:59.142
and the y-axis shows either the surge multiplier for the left graph, or the price for the right graph.

0:01:00.262 --> 0:01:01.086
Finally

0:01:02.077 --> 0:01:04.077
This visualization shows three graphs

0:01:04.077 --> 0:01:08.097
The first of which shows how the distance on the x-axis

0:01:08.165 --> 0:01:11.262
changes with the price on the y-axis.

0:01:11.418 --> 0:01:13.936
Each dot represents a ride.

0:01:15.010 --> 0:01:19.371
The next scatterplot shows how the surge multiplier changes throughout November

0:01:19.371 --> 0:01:21.468
and all the way through to December.

0:01:21.920 --> 0:01:23.920
The date being on the x-axis

0:01:24.001 --> 0:01:26.001
and the surge multiplier being on the y

0:01:27.319 --> 0:01:30.399
Finally, there is a bar graph that shows how many rides

0:01:31.725 --> 0:01:33.725
start in each region of Boston.

0:01:34.041 --> 0:01:37.577
The regions are on the x-axis and the count of trips are on the y.

0:01:39.002 --> 0:01:41.581
Highlighting over given points will illuminate

0:01:41.581 --> 0:01:44.424
their corresponding ride on the other scatterplot

0:01:44.611 --> 0:01:46.137
and also highlight

0:01:46.289 --> 0:01:48.851
the starting locations of the rides selected.
